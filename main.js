// Party Buses.
// A party bus can hold 25 passengers, allowing 25 people to travel. Given (numberOfPeople), return how many buses are needed to seat everyone.
//ðŸ‘‰ Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:

export function howManyBuses(numberOfPeople)  {
    const busCapacity = 25; // 25 people per bus
    const numBuses = []; // empty array to store the number of buses needed
    for (let i = 0; i < numberOfPeople.length; i++) {
        numBuses.push(Math.ceil(numberOfPeople[i] / busCapacity)); // Math.ceil rounds up to the nearest whole number
    }
    return numBuses; // return the number of buses needed
}
/*console.log(howManyBuses(60));
console.log(howManyBuses(108));
console.log(howManyBuses(248));*/

// -------- //

// A bus can hold twentyfive passengers, allowing twentyfive people to travel around. Given i number of people, return how many buses are needed to seat everyone comfortably.

// For example, howManyBuses(25) should return 1, and howManyBuses(51) should return 3.

/*function howManyBuses(i) {
    const howManyBuses = 25; // 25 people per bus (i=25)
    const totalBuses = Math.ceil(i / howManyBuses); // Math.ceil rounds up to the nearest whole number

    return totalBuses;
};
console.log(howManyBuses(52));*/
